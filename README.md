IMDB 50k Reviews Dataset - Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling

Overview

This project analyzes the IMDB 50k movie reviews dataset, focusing on two primary tasks:

Sentiment Analysis Classifier: Classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

Topic Modeling: Discover common themes and topics discussed in the reviews using advanced NLP techniques.

The analysis includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insightful visualizations.
